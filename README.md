# NLP Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the NLP Sentiment Analysis project repository! ðŸš€

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with sentiment analysis, leveraging Python and machine learning techniques to extract invaluable insights from textual data. The mission is to empower businesses and stakeholders with actionable intelligence derived from the sentiment analysis of text data.

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilize NLTK for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stop word removal, to prepare textual data for analysis.
- **Bag-of-Words Representation**: Implement a Bag-of-Words approach to convert text data into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning models.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Train a Random Forest classifier to predict sentiment labels based on the Bag-of-Words representations of text data.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Deploy a Streamlit web application to facilitate interactive sentiment analysis predictions for user-provided text inputs.
